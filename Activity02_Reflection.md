This activity covered several different geom functions to add layers to ggplot2. I am comfortable starting a ggplot with a dataset, like 
> ggplot(data=penguins).

For the most part I am comfortable with different aesthetics, although I think I can become more comfortable over time with global vs variable aesthetics and the 
syntax/placement of different options. I look forward to learning different geom functions as well as aesthetics.
